I'm fighting a battle</br>
I'm fighting my shadow</br>
Herd fears like they're cattle</br>
I'm fighting a battle, yeah</br>
I'm fighting my ego</br>
Lost youth, where did we go wrong?</br>
I'm fighting for me, though</br>
I'm lighting the long way home </br>
</p>
<p><p class = "center_text">
Oh, the past it haunted me</br>
Oh, the past it wanted me dead</br>
Oh, the past tormented me</br>
Oh, the past it wanted me dead</br>
Oh, the past it haunted me</br>
Oh, the past it wanted me dead</br>
Oh, the past tormented me</br>
But the battle was lost</br>
'Cause I'm still here</br>
</p>
<p><p class = "center_text">
I'm winning the war now</br>
I'm winning it all now</br>
Watch tears while they fall down</br>
I'm winning the war now</br>
I win against ego</br>
Cast light on the shadow's long</br>
I'm winning from ego</br>
I'm lighting the long way home</br>
</p>
