<h2> Danielle Lair Ferrari </h2>

<p> Danielle Lair Ferrari is born to an Austrian father and an Uruguayan mother in the junction of two continents, Washington D.C., where she grew up in a mix of cultures. Owning three languages she felt communication design would be the most appropriate alternative. She is the youngest of three siblings having an older brother and sister. Since being a baby she was traveling to Europe and South America. She can imagine living in a world without boundaries and still always coming back home. She attended the German international school of Washington D.C. where she was able to develop a passion for photography being the event photographer of the school and in charge of her school's annual yearbook. At the New school, Parsons she is majoring in communication design. Furthermore, she grew up around the water as a swimmer and later as a diver, lifeguard, and coach. Her ultimate love, however, is on the soccer field. </p>
